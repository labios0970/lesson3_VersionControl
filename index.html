            <p class="lead">Version Control allows users to record changes to a project and its previous version of the project without deleting the previous versions. This allows the user to refer back to a previous versions if they need to retrace something they did. The version control system also allows you to work with others on projects, and let’s you use the versions of other team members to assist one another. One of the more popular VCS is the local type, which works by copying files into another directory, but is prone to error. Centralized version control systems allow many users to have access of each other’s files. This has become the standard for version control systems. Distributed Version control systems fully mirror the repository of the computer. This allows clones to be produced which lets the server act as a backup for all the data.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git utilizes something that other VCSs don’t. Git stores data more like a snapshot instead of saving a set of files. This allows untouched files to remain the same in a new commit so it is more efficient. Basically, it will not store a file if it does not need to. The three states your files can reside in include: the committed, the modified, and the staged. Committed refers to data safely stored in your local database. Modified refers to your edited file, but you have yet to commit it to the database. Staged , refers to your modified file in its current version and how it is up to date.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In order to obtain a Git repository, you can either clone an existing repository, or you can take a local directory that is not under a VCS, and turn it into a Git repository. Typing $ git init will create a subdirectory that is the framework for a new repository. To start version-controlling files, start tracking those files and type & git add and & git commit. This will allow you to start tracking your files. Copying an existing Git repository will give you a full copy of a repository. This can assist in solving a corrupted server disk problem.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Editing files will cause Git to see them as modified. As you go through edits, commits, and so forth, your files will go through being tracked, untracked, unmodified, modified, states, and the cycles will repeat itself. To find out what file is at what state, use the & git status command. To start tracking a file, use the & git add ‘file name’. This will allow you to start tracking a file. To remove files, type & git rm. Another useful tool is knowing how to move a file. In order to do that, use & git mv ‘file from’ to ‘file to’.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Linux kernel was the core beginning of what is known now today as Git. During maintenance for Linux kernel, different changes were being passed around the community. In 2002, the project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper. Three years later, the community and the company of BitKeeper broke apart. The tool’s free of charge status was removed which caused the Linux community to develop their own “DVCS”. Using knowledge from what they learned using BitKeeper, they focused mainly on: speed, simple designs, strong non-linear development support, being able to handle large projects, and to make it fully distributed. Thus, Git was born and is still evolving, and has become a staple for non-linear development.</p>
